# LV Examples

This folder contains runnable examples for **left ventricle (LV)** workflows.

Planned examples:
1. LV forward inflation (given material params + unloaded geometry → pressurized geometry)
2. LV inverse identification (given unloaded/pressurized observations → material params)
3. Orientation generation (rule-based fiber/material orientation)

Start here:
- `LV_FEA_QN_forward_inflation.py`
- `LV_FEA_inverse_mat_ex_vivo_NN.py`
