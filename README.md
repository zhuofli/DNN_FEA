# PyTorch FEA

The repo has the refactored code of our paper published at Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, titled "**PyTorch-FEA: Autograd-enabled Finite Element Analysis Methods with Applications for Biomechanical Analysis of Human Aorta**" at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107616

I am working to make it useful for more applications.

The orignal code of the paper is available at https://github.com/liangbright/pytorch_fea_paper

The preprint of our paper is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.533816v1

PyTorch-FEA needs the mesh library at https://github.com/liangbright/mesh

Example data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ByOjc9RVFEexLXB-u6Qd1SMAS-BKvW3g/view?usp=sharing

Try those examples:

forward analysis:
   > aorta_FEA_QN_forward_inflation.py to obtain pressurized geometry given material parameters and unpressurized geometry. 

inverse analysis:
> (1) aorta_FEA_inverse_mat_ex_vivo.py to obtain material parameters given pressurized and unpressurized geometries. \
> (2) aorta_FEA_QN_inverse_p0.py to obtain unpressurized geometry given material parameters and pressurized geometry. \
> (3) aorta_FEA_QN_GPA_prestress.py to obtain stress and strain of pressurized geometry given material parameters. \
> note: residual stress/strain is not considered

stress analysis by static determinacy:
> use a stiff material (e.g., --mat "50000, 0, 1, 0.3333, 0, 1e5"' ' --mat_model GOH_Jv') \
> run aorta_FEA_QN_inverse_p0.py \
> the stress is stored on the mesh file of the unpressurized geometry.

Dependency: PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, and PyPardiso
